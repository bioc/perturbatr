Description: `knockout` does analysis of large-scale gene knockout/knockdown screens.
 For this several preprocessing and data normalization techniques such as *median-polish* or *quantile-quantile normalization* are implemented.
 On the normalized data-set essential hits can be prioritized using state-of-the-art analysis tools, such as *gespeR* or *pmm*.
 The resulting hit lists can be further extended using network diffusion algorithms, such as *Markov random walks with restarts* or the well-known *heat equation*.
 Eventually hits can be analyses using GSEA, etc.
